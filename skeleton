A GitHub Actions workflow skeleton provides a basic structure for automating tasks within a GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files within the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository.
Here's a common skeleton for a basic GitHub Actions workflow:

name: My Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test


Explanation of the skeleton:
name: A human-readable name for your workflow. This appears in the GitHub Actions UI.
on: Defines the events that trigger the workflow.
push: Triggers the workflow when code is pushed to the specified branches (e.g., main).
pull_request: Triggers the workflow when a pull request is opened, synchronized, or reopened targeting the specified branches.
jobs: A collection of jobs that run in the workflow.
build: The name of a specific job. You can have multiple jobs.
runs-on: Specifies the type of runner (virtual machine) where the job will execute (e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest).
steps: A sequence of tasks that the job will perform.
name: A descriptive name for each step.
uses: Specifies a reusable action from the GitHub Marketplace or a local action (e.g., actions/checkout@v4 to check out your repository code).
with: Provides input parameters to the action (e.g., node-version: '20' for actions/setup-node).
run: Executes a command-line script directly on the runner.
